## Vulnerable_Wordpress_Exploitation
This is designed to be a group project and each participant ran the entire Red Team process on their own. We collaborated and divided duties up to generate the report. My duties for the report were to list the expolits we used to access the system slides 7-10.

### Step 1 - Red Team Engagement 
- Assess the given ip address
- Determine it was a wordpress built website
- Enumerate Users via wpscan
- Brute Force password (no tool needed)
- Navigated system and found SQL Database username and password
- Logged into SQL Database and found second users name and password hash
- Utilized John to crack password hash
- Utilized a Python Priviledge Esclation Expolit to gain root access

### Step 2 - Red Team Engagement Report
- Show Network Topography 
- List Critical Vulnerabilities
- List exploits used to gain access
- List Flags found
- Explaination on Maintaining access by avoiding dectection
